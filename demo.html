      <h3>Case 1: GERD Management</h3>
      <p>A 54-year-old man comes to the clinic for management of his gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). He is currently on cimetidine for his condition and reports that his GERD initially improved. However, following his recent move to Michigan, he is experiencing more frequent episodes of chest pain (4-5 times a week). The pain is described as burning in quality and is concentrated around his epigastric region following food ingestion. It does not radiate anywhere and is alleviated when he takes antacids. A physical examination demonstrates a healthy male with unremarkable findings. He is subsequently prescribed a new medication for control of his symptoms. What is the most likely mechanism of action of this new medication?<br><br> 
      (A) Irreversible inactivation of cyclooxygenase enzyme<br> 
      (B) Irreversible inhibition of H+/K+-ATPase at parietal cells<br>

      <h3>Case 2: Headache & Brain Lesion</h3>
      <p>A 52-year-old woman presents with a complaint of headache for the past 10 days. Her headache is diffuse, dull in character, moderate in intensity, and is worse in the morning. It is not associated with fever and sensitivity to light or sound. She experiences occasional nausea but no vomiting. She did not have similar headaches in the past. Her blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg; pulse, 60/min, and body mass index is 33.5 kg/m2. The neurological examination reveals normal extraocular movements. Mild bilateral papilledema is present. A magnetic resonance imaging of the brain reveals a solitary lesion in the left temporal region with predominant hemorrhage.

Despite initial improvement, his symptoms have worsened, indicating that cimetidine is no longer effective.<br>2. <strong>Symptoms</strong>: The patient experiences burning chest pain in the epigastric region after eating, which is alleviated by antacids. This is consistent with GERD.<br>3. <strong>New Medication</strong>: Given that the patient's symptoms have worsened despite H2 receptor antagonist therapy, the next step in management typically involves a more potent acid suppression therapy.<br>4. <strong>Mechanism of Action</strong>: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly prescribed when H2 receptor antagonists are insufficient. PPIs work by irreversibly inhibiting the H+/K+-ATPase enzyme in the parietal cells of the stomach, leading to a significant reduction in gastric acid production.<br>5. <strong>Options Analysis</strong>:<br>  - (E) Reversible inhibition of histamine H2 receptors: This describes the action of H2 receptor antagonists like cimetidine, which the patient is already taking.<br>   - (D) Reversible inhibition of H+/K+-ATPase at parietal cells: This is not the typical mechanism of action for commonly used GERD medications.<br>   - (B) Irreversible inhibition of H+/K+-ATPase at parietal cells: This describes the action of PPIs, which are the next step in treatment for GERD.<br>   - (A) Irreversible inactivation of cyclooxygenase enzyme: This describes the action of NSAIDs, which are not used for GERD.<br>   - (C) Irreversible inhibition of histamine H2 receptors: This is not a known mechanism for GERD medications.<br><br>Given the above analysis, the most likely mechanism of action of the new medication prescribed for this patient is:<br><br>Answer: (B) Irreversible inhibition of H+/K+-ATPase at parietal cells.", receiver: "Self"}
